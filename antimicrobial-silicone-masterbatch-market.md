<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antimicrobial Silicone Masterbatch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Resin</li><li>Thermosetting Resin</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Antimicrobial Silicone Masterbatch Market comprises two main types: thermoplastic resin and thermosetting resin markets. Thermoplastic resin refers to a type of polymer that can be melted and re-molded repeatedly without undergoing any significant chemical change. These resins have a wide variety of applications due to their versatility and easy processability. On the other hand, thermosetting resin refers to a polymer that hardens irreversibly when cured. Once cured, it cannot be melted or reformed, making it ideal for applications that require durability and resistance to heat and chemicals.</p></p>
