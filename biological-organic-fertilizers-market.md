<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biological Organic Fertilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microorganism</li><li>Organic Residues</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Biological organic fertilizers are categorized into two main types - microorganism and organic residues. Microorganism-based fertilizers, as the name suggests, consist of beneficial microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and algae. These microorganisms help in improving soil fertility and nutrient availability for plants. On the other hand, organic residues, such as compost, animal manure, and green manure, are derived from natural sources and provide essential nutrients and organic matter to the soil. Both types of fertilizers are used in organic farming practices to enhance soil health, crop yield, and sustainability.</p></p>
