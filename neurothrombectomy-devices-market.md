<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurothrombectomy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retriever</li><li>Integrated System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Neurothrombectomy devices are utilized for the treatment of stroke caused by blood clots in the brain. The market for these devices can be classified into two types: retriever and integrated system. Retriever devices are small, flexible tools that physically remove the clot from the blood vessel, allowing blood flow to be restored. Integrated system devices, on the other hand, combine retriever technology with other components like stent retrievers or aspiration devices to achieve better clot removal results. Both types of devices play a crucial role in improving outcomes for stroke patients.</p></p>
