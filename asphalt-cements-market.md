<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Asphalt Cements Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coal Tar Pitch</li><li>Asphalt</li><li>Natural Asphalt</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Asphalt cements refer to the binding materials used in asphalt pavements and roofing applications. There are three main types of asphalt cements: coal tar pitch, asphalt, and natural asphalt. Coal tar pitch is derived from coal and is known for its excellent waterproofing properties but has limited availability due to environmental concerns. Asphalt cement, derived from petroleum, is the most commonly used type and offers good durability and flexibility. Natural asphalt, found in natural deposits, is less commonly used and offers similar properties to petroleum-derived asphalt.</p></p>
