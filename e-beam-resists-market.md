<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The E-beam Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive E-beam Resists</li><li>Negative E-beam Resists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>E-beam resists refer to materials used for electron beam lithography, a technique used in semiconductor manufacturing. Positive E-beam resists react when exposed to an electron beam and become more soluble, allowing for the removal of the exposed areas. They are commonly used for creating nanostructures. Negative E-beam resists, on the other hand, become less soluble when exposed to an electron beam, enabling the preservation of the exposed areas during development. Both types of E-beam resists serve different purposes and cater to different applications in the market.</p></p>
