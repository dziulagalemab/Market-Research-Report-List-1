<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UV (Ultraviolet) Curable Inks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Free Radical Polymerization Type</li><li>Free Radical Addition Molding</li><li>Cationic Polymerization</li><li>Acid Cure Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>UV (Ultraviolet) curable inks are classified into four main types: Free Radical Polymerization Type, Free Radical Addition Molding, Cationic Polymerization, and Acid Cure Type. </p><p>1. Free Radical Polymerization Type: In this process, UV light initiates the reaction that leads to ink curing. It is widely used in various applications due to its versatility and rapid curing time.</p><p>2. Free Radical Addition Molding: This type of UV curable ink uses a similar process to the Free Radical Polymerization Type but is specifically designed for molding applications, where the ink is cured within a mold.</p><p>3. Cationic Polymerization: Instead of using free radicals, cationic UV curable inks utilize cationic photoinitiators to initiate the curing reaction. This type is commonly used for heat-sensitive substrates and allows for deep curing.</p><p>4. Acid Cure Type: Acid cure UV curable inks rely on a dual curing mechanism. The ink crosslinks through a reaction between a photoinitiator and an acid, resulting in a durable and chemical-resistant cured ink film. It is often used in the printing of labels and packaging materials.</p></p>
