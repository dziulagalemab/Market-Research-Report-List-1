<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The car tire market is primarily categorized into two types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires have steel belts running perpendicular to the direction of travel, providing better grip, fuel efficiency, and heat dissipation. They offer a smoother ride and longer tread life. On the other hand, bias tires have layers that crisscross at an angle, offering greater puncture resistance but less flexibility and heat resistance. They are commonly used in off-road vehicles and heavy-duty applications. Ultimately, choosing between radial and bias tires depends on the specific vehicle's requirements and usage.</p></p>
