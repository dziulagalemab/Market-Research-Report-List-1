<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EVA Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal EVA</li><li>Anti-PID EVA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EVA film is commonly used in the solar industry for laminating solar panels. Normal EVA film is a standard type that offers good adhesion and encapsulation properties. It provides reliable protection to the solar cells from moisture and other environmental factors. On the other hand, Anti-PID (Potential Induced Degradation) EVA film is specifically designed to prevent potential-induced degradation, a phenomenon that can reduce the performance and lifespan of solar panels. It effectively inhibits the penetration of harmful ions, ensuring the long-term efficiency of solar modules. Both types play a crucial role in solar panel manufacturing and performance.</p></p>
