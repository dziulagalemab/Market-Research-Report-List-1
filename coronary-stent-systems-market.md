<p><h1>Coronary Stent Systems Market Growth, Market Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts for period from 2023 - 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Coronary Stent Systems Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Coronary stent systems are small mesh-like devices that are placed in narrowed or blocked arteries to maintain blood flow and prevent heart attacks. These stents are typically made of metal alloys like stainless steel or cobalt-chromium and can be either bare metal or coated with a drug to release over time, known as drug-eluting stents. They are used in the treatment of coronary artery disease, a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrow due to the buildup of plaques.</p><p>The coronary stent systems market has been experiencing significant growth in recent years and is expected to continue to do so during the forecast period. Factors such as increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, technological advancements in stent design, and rising geriatric population contribute to the market's growth. Additionally, the growing demand for minimally invasive procedures and advancements in healthcare infrastructure further propel the market's expansion.</p><p>Furthermore, emerging trends in the coronary stent systems market include the preference for drug-eluting stents over bare metal stents due to their higher effectiveness in preventing restenosis (the recurrence of artery narrowing). The development of bioresorbable stents, which are absorbed into the body overtime, is also gaining traction, as they eliminate the need for long-term stent presence.</p><p>In conclusion, the coronary stent systems market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% during the forecast period. The market's growth is driven by factors such as the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, technological advancements, and the rising demand for minimally invasive procedures. Emerging trends include the preference for drug-eluting stents and the development of bioresorbable stents.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coronary Stent Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare Metal Stents</li><li>Drug-Eluting Stents</li><li>Fully Bio-Absorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coronary stent systems market includes three types of stents: bare metal stents (BMS), drug-eluting stents (DES), and fully bio-absorbable stents. BMS are metallic stents that help in maintaining vessel patency after angioplasty. DES are coated with drugs that reduce the risk of restenosis, where the blood vessel narrows again. Fully bio-absorbable stents fully dissolve over time, leaving behind a healed vessel. These stents are used in the treatment of coronary artery disease and offer various benefits depending on the patient's condition and requirements.</p></p>
