<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Noise, Vibration, and Harshness Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bonded</li><li>Non-bonded</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) sealants are used in vehicles to minimize noise, vibrations, and harshness. The market for these sealants can be divided into two types: bonded and non-bonded. Bonded NVH sealants are designed to create a strong adhesive bond between surfaces, providing a more secure and durable solution. On the other hand, non-bonded NVH sealants do not require adhesion and are often used to fill gaps and crevices to prevent the transmission of noise and vibrations. Both types offer effective solutions for reducing NVH levels in automobiles.</p></p>
