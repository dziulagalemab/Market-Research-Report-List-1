<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid-Applied House Wrap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Barrier</li><li>Water Resistive Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluid-applied house wrap refers to a liquid coating applied to the external walls of a building to provide protection against air and water infiltration. It serves two primary functions: acting as an air barrier and a water resistive barrier. An air barrier prevents the flow of air through the building envelope, thus reducing energy loss and improving indoor air quality. A water resistive barrier prevents water from penetrating into the building, preventing moisture-related issues such as mold growth and structural damage. both are essential in maintaining the integrity and durability of a building.</p></p>
