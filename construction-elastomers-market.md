<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Elastomers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Thermoset Plastic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Construction elastomers are widely used in the construction industry for various applications due to their unique physical properties. There are two main types of construction elastomers in the market: thermoplastic and thermoset plastic elastomers. </p><p>Thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are materials that can be melted and reprocessed multiple times without losing their original properties. They offer advantages such as easy recycling, excellent flexibility, and high impact resistance. TPEs are commonly used in applications like weatherstripping, sealants, and roofing membranes in the construction industry.</p><p>On the other hand, thermoset plastic elastomers are materials that undergo a permanent chemical change upon curing, which gives them their final shape. Once cured, they cannot be melted or reprocessed. Thermoset plastic elastomers provide enhanced durability, high temperature resistance, and excellent chemical resistance. These materials are frequently used in applications like gaskets, coatings, and adhesives for construction purposes.</p><p>Both thermoplastic and thermoset plastic elastomers play a crucial role in the construction industry, offering different advantages and applications based on their unique properties.</p></p>
