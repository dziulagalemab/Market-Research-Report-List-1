<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Food Grade Liquid Nitrogen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cryogenic Distillation</li><li>Pressure Swing Adsorption</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The food grade liquid nitrogen market includes two main types of technology: cryogenic distillation and pressure swing adsorption. Cryogenic distillation involves the separation of nitrogen and oxygen by cooling the air to extremely low temperatures and then distilling the components. This method is widely used for large-scale production. Pressure swing adsorption, on the other hand, utilizes adsorbents to selectively capture nitrogen gas from air under high pressure. This technique is suited for smaller-scale operations and provides a continuous supply of nitrogen gas. Both methods ensure the production of high-quality food grade liquid nitrogen without any impurities.</p></p>
