<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gypsum Centrifuges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Centrifuge</li><li>Vertical Centrifuge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gypsum centrifuges market comprises two main types: horizontal centrifuges and vertical centrifuges. Horizontal centrifuges are designed to handle larger volumes of gypsum slurry and are commonly used in industrial applications due to their high processing capacity. They employ a rotating drum positioned horizontally to separate the solid and liquid components of gypsum. Vertical centrifuges, on the other hand, operate with a vertically positioned drum and are more suitable for smaller-scale operations. They are known for their compact size, efficient performance, and ability to handle finer gypsum particles.</p></p>
