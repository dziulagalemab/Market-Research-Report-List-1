<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyvinyl Alcohol in Cosmetic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Hydrolized</li><li>Partially Hydrolized</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) is a synthetic polymer widely used in the cosmetic industry. It can be categorized into two types based on its degree of hydrolysis: fully hydrolyzed and partially hydrolyzed PVA. </p><p>Fully hydrolyzed PVA has undergone complete hydrolysis, resulting in a water-soluble polymer. It is often used in cosmetics as a binder, film-former, and thickener, providing excellent adhesion and film-forming properties.</p><p>Partially hydrolyzed PVA, on the other hand, retains some of its water-insoluble properties. It is commonly utilized in cosmetic products as an emulsion stabilizer, giving them a stable texture and preventing separation of different ingredients. Both forms of PVA offer unique applications in the cosmetic market, catering to specific formulation requirements.</p></p>
