<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alfalfa Seeds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dormant Seed</li><li>Non Dormant Seed</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The alfalfa seeds market consists of two main types: Dormant Seed and Non-Dormant Seed. Dormant seeds are those that have undergone a natural period of dormancy, allowing them to remain viable even under unfavorable conditions. These seeds have a higher germination rate and are typically preferred by farmers who want to ensure successful crop establishment. On the other hand, non-dormant seeds do not require a period of dormancy and can germinate quickly after being planted. They are advantageous for farmers looking for faster crop growth and earlier harvest.</p></p>
