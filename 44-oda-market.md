<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 4,4\'-ODA Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>RecrystallizationType</li><li>SublimationType</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 4,4'-ODA market can be categorized into two types: the recrystallization type and the sublimation type. In the recrystallization type, 4,4'-ODA is purified by dissolving it in a solvent, allowing impurities to form crystals, and then filtering them out. This method is suitable for large-scale production. On the other hand, in the sublimation type, 4,4'-ODA is heated and vaporized, allowing impurities to be separated as a solid residue. This method is preferred for high-purity requirements but is often limited to small-scale production.</p></p>
