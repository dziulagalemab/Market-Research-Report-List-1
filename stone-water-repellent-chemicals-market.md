<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stone Water Repellent Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Based</li><li>Solvent Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stone water repellent chemicals refer to substances used to make stone surfaces waterproof and resistant to water absorption. There are two types of stone water repellent chemicals: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based repellents are made up of water as the main component and offer environmentally-friendly properties, quick drying time, and easy application. On the other hand, solvent-based repellents utilize solvents as their main component, ensuring better penetration into the stone substrates, higher durability, and resistance to weathering impacts. Both types provide long-lasting protection against water damage and help maintain the aesthetic appeal of stone surfaces.</p></p>
