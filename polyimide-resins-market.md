<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polyimide resins are a type of high-performance polymer used in various industries. They can be classified into two types: thermoplastics and thermosetting. Thermoplastics are polymers that can be easily melted and re-molded multiple times without sacrificing their properties. In contrast, thermosetting polyimides undergo a chemical reaction during curing and become rigid and infusible. Once cured, they cannot be melted or re-molded. Both types have their unique properties and find applications in industries such as electronics, aerospace, automotive, and others.</p></p>
