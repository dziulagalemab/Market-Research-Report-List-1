<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hard Seal V Port Ball Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flangedless</li><li>Flanged</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hard seal V port ball valves come in two main market types: flangedless and flanged. Flangedless ball valves feature a design without flanges, allowing for direct welding onto pipelines. This type of valve is preferred in applications where reduced weight, compactness, and lower cost are important factors. On the other hand, flanged ball valves come with flanges at the ends, which facilitate easy installation and connection with pipelines using bolts. These valves are commonly used in applications where frequent maintenance or valve replacement is required.</p></p>
