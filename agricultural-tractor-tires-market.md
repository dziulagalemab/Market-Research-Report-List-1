<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Tractor Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Bias Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural tractor tires market consists of two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are designed with layers of rubber running radially from the center, providing improved flexibility and traction. These tires offer better fuel efficiency, reduced soil compaction, and longer life spans. In contrast, bias tires have multiple layers of rubber crisscrossing at angles, resulting in a stronger sidewall and increased load-carrying capacity. Although bias tires are generally less expensive, they often provide lower fuel efficiency and greater soil compaction compared to radial tires.</p></p>
