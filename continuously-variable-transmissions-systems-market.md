<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuously Variable Transmissions Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal Belt</li><li>Metal Chain</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVT) systems are a type of automatic transmission that can seamlessly change through an infinite number of gear ratios. CVTs are commonly categorized into two types based on the material used for their belt or chain: Metal Belt and Metal Chain. Metal Belt CVTs use a metal belt that connects two variable-diameter pulleys, allowing for efficient power transfer and smooth gear ratio changes. On the other hand, Metal Chain CVTs employ a metal chain running over two sets of pulleys, providing similar benefits in terms of smooth performance and power transmission.</p></p>
