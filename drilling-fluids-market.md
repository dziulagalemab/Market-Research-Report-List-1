<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drilling Fluids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-based Fluids (OBF)</li><li>Water-based Fluids (WBF)</li><li>Synthetic-based Fluids (SBF)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Drilling fluids, also known as drilling mud, are essential for the process of drilling oil and gas wells. There are three main types of drilling fluids: oil-based fluids (OBF), water-based fluids (WBF), and synthetic-based fluids (SBF). OBF are formulated using oil as their base, providing good lubrication, temperature stability, and better wellbore stability. WBF, on the other hand, use water as the base, making them more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. SBF are a combination of oil and water, offering the benefits of both OBF and WBF while minimizing their limitations.</p></p>
