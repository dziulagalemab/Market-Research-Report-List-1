<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive ABS and ESC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Three Channel ABS</li><li>Four Channel ABS</li><li>ESC</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) is a safety feature that prevents wheels from locking up during hard braking, allowing the driver to maintain steering control. Three Channel ABS utilizes sensors on three wheels, excluding the rear one, to detect wheel speed variations and regulate brake pressure accordingly. Four Channel ABS involves sensors on all four wheels, providing enhanced stability and control. ESC (Electronic Stability Control) is an advanced technology that goes beyond ABS, detecting and reducing loss of traction by selectively applying brakes to individual wheels and adjusting engine power. It further enhances vehicle stability and prevents skidding.</p></p>
