<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant Polyamide Fibre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Copolymerization</li><li>Blending Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame retardant polyamide fibers are categorized into two types: copolymerization and blending method. In copolymerization, flame retardant additives are directly incorporated into the polymer chain during the fiber production process. This ensures consistent and long-lasting flame retardant properties throughout the fiber. On the other hand, in the blending method, flame retardant additives are mixed into the polymer during fiber spinning. Although this method may provide lower flame retardant effectiveness compared to copolymerization, it is cost-effective and allows for the production of different flame retardant levels in the fibers.</p></p>
