<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elastomeric Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sheet</li><li>Liquid Applied</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Elastomeric membrane market includes two types: sheet and liquid applied. Sheet membranes are pre-formed membranes made of elastomeric materials that are rolled out onto a surface and adhered using adhesive or heat. They provide a single uniform layer of protection against water and air infiltration. On the other hand, liquid applied membranes are applied as a liquid coating that cures into a flexible, elastomeric membrane. They provide a seamless, monolithic layer of protection and are ideal for complex or irregular surfaces. Both types offer excellent durability and resistance to weathering and UV rays.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Elastomeric Membrane Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roofs & Walls</li><li>Underground Construction</li><li>Wet Areas</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Elastomeric membrane is extensively used in various applications including roofs and walls, underground construction, wet areas, and others. In the context of roofs and walls, elastomeric membrane is applied as a protective layer to prevent water infiltration, improve thermal insulation, and enhance durability. It is also used in underground construction to provide water and vapor barrier, and ensure the structural integrity of tunnels and basements. In wet areas such as bathrooms and swimming pools, elastomeric membrane is used to create a waterproof and durable surface. Furthermore, elastomeric membrane finds applications in other areas where water resistance, flexibility, and durability are required.</p></p>
