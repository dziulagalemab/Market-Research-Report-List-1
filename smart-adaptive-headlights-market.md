<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Adaptive Headlights Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AFS</li><li>ABD</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Smart Adaptive Headlights are innovative lighting systems that automatically adjust the direction and intensity of the headlights to enhance visibility and safety while driving. They include two major types: Adaptive Front-Lighting Systems (AFS) and Adaptive Beam Design (ABD). AFS utilizes sensors and actuators to swivel the headlights in response to steering inputs, ensuring better illumination around curves and corners. ABD uses sensors to detect oncoming vehicles and dynamically adjusts the beam pattern to prevent dazzling other drivers. These advanced lighting technologies improve visibility and reduce accidents, making night driving safer and more comfortable.</p></p>
