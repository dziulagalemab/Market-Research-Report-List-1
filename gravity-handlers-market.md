<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gravity Handlers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Site</li><li>Dual Site</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gravity handlers are divided into two main market types: single site and dual site markets. In a single site market, there is only one facility responsible for handling gravity, such as a processing plant. This means that all gravitational processes and operations are concentrated in a single location. On the other hand, a dual site market involves two separate locations that handle gravity-related tasks. These sites may have different responsibilities, such as one site focusing on gravity input and the other on gravity output, providing a more distributed and specialized approach to gravity handling.</p></p>
