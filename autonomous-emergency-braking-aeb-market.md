<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forward Collision Warning</li><li>Dynamic Brake Support</li><li>Crash Imminent Braking</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) is a safety system in vehicles that helps prevent accidents by automatically applying brakes when a potential collision is detected. Three market types are Forward Collision Warning, Dynamic Brake Support, and Crash Imminent Braking. Forward Collision Warning alerts the driver of an approaching crash, while Dynamic Brake Support provides additional braking force when the driver's braking is insufficient. Crash Imminent Braking takes over the braking function completely when a crash appears unavoidable, reducing the severity of the impact or avoiding it altogether.</p></p>
